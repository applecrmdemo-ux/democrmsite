You are working on an existing full-stack CRM demo project that has already been uploaded.

IMPORTANT:

* Do NOT rebuild the project from scratch
* Analyze and extend the current codebase
* Keep existing architecture and modules intact
* Ensure everything runs without runtime or console errors

Tech Stack (already in project):
Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Axios
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: MongoDB + Mongoose
API Base: /api/*

====================================================
STEP 1 — Stabilize System
=========================

1. Explore entire repository structure
2. Ensure backend starts correctly
3. Ensure frontend runs
4. Fix dependency issues
5. Fix broken imports
6. Fix API mismatches
7. Verify MongoDB connection
8. Resolve ALL console errors

====================================================
STEP 2 — Implement Login System (Simple Demo Only)
==================================================

Do NOT build full authentication.

Create a lightweight role-based login simulation using hardcoded credentials:

Owner/Admin
username: admin
password: password

Sales Staff
username: salesman
password: password

Technician
username: tech
password: password

Manager
username: manager
password: password

Customer
username: customer
password: password

Requirements:

* Login page UI
* Role stored in local state/session
* Redirect to role-based dashboard
* No JWT or hashing required
* Clean professional UI

====================================================
STEP 3 — Implement FULL CRM MODULES
===================================

Make all modules fully functional with UI + API + DB integration.

🧑‍💼 Customer Management

* Add/edit/delete customers
* Contact storage
* Purchase history tracking
* Warranty tracking field
* Segment tagging (New/VIP/etc)
* Reminder flag support

📦 Product & Inventory

* Product catalog CRUD
* Stock tracking
* Low stock alerts
* Supplier field
* Sales trend stats support

🛒 Sales & Billing

* Link to customers
* Reduce inventory automatically
* Generate invoice view
* Payment status tracking
* Sales analytics

🛠 Service & Repair

* Create repair ticket
* Track serial/IMEI
* Assign technician
* Status pipeline:
  Received
  Diagnosing
  In Repair
  Completed
  Delivered
* Notes history

💬 Leads & Enquiries

* Capture enquiries
* Call-back tracking
* Product interest tagging
* Convert lead → customer

📅 Appointment Scheduling

* Book repair/demo
* Calendar-style UI
* Conflict detection
* Staff visibility

📊 Dashboard Analytics
Show:

* Revenue overview
* Best-selling products
* Active repairs
* Customer growth
* Inventory alerts

Use chart library (Recharts preferred)

====================================================
STEP 4 — Architecture Integration Rules
=======================================

Ensure module interaction:

Customer purchase
→ Sales module records
→ Inventory reduces stock
→ Customer history updated
→ Dashboard analytics update

Repair booking
→ Appointment created
→ Repair record created
→ Status tracking enabled

Central MongoDB database shared across modules

====================================================
STEP 5 — UI/UX QUALITY
======================

Upgrade to enterprise-level dashboard:

* Sidebar layout
* Responsive tables
* Modals/forms
* Loading indicators
* Error states
* Pagination
* Global search
* Clean spacing
* Consistent theme

====================================================
STEP 6 — Code Quality
=====================

* Modular structure
* No duplicated logic
* Proper API separation
* Comments where useful
* Maintainability prioritized
* Zero console errors

====================================================
STEP 7 — Deliverables
=====================

After completion provide:

1. Summary of changes
2. How to run instructions
3. New routes added
4. New DB models added
5. UI pages created
