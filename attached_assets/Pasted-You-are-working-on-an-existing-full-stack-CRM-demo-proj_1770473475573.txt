You are working on an existing full-stack CRM demo project that I have uploaded.
DO NOT rebuild from scratch. You must analyze the codebase and continue development.

Project context:

This is a full-stack CRM system for an Apple-style retail store focused on store management operations.

Tech stack:

* Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + Axios
* Backend: Node.js + Express
* Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
* API Base URL: [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api)

Existing modules implemented:

* Customers
* Products / Inventory
* Repairs
* Appointments
* Dashboard stats

Backend provides CRUD routes:

* /api/customers
* /api/products
* /api/repairs
* /api/appointments
* /api/dashboard/stats

Your responsibilities:

STEP 1 — Understand the Codebase

* Explore folder structure
* Identify entry points
* Confirm backend server starts correctly
* Confirm frontend runs
* Fix dependency or path issues
* Ensure MongoDB connection works
* Resolve ALL runtime or console errors

STEP 2 — Stabilize the System

* Verify frontend API calls match backend routes
* Fix CORS issues if any
* Ensure Axios base URL is correct
* Add missing environment configs if needed
* Ensure no broken imports or build errors

STEP 3 — Upgrade UI to Professional Level
Improve UI without breaking logic:

* Enterprise dashboard layout
* Sidebar navigation polish
* Responsive tables
* Loading indicators
* Empty states
* Error handling
* Form validation
* Clean spacing/typography

STEP 4 — Add High-Value CRM Features
Extend system by implementing:

1️⃣ Orders / Sales Module

* Create order
* Link to customer
* Reduce product stock
* Store order history

2️⃣ Analytics Charts

* Sales trends
* Inventory status
* Repair status
  Use Recharts or Chart.js

3️⃣ Global Search

* Search customers/products

4️⃣ Pagination

* Tables should not load all data at once

STEP 5 — Code Quality Requirements

* Keep modular architecture
* Follow best practices
* Do not duplicate logic
* Add comments where necessary
* Maintain existing structure
* Ensure app runs with ZERO console errors

STEP 6 — Deliverables
After changes:

* Explain what you modified
* Show how to run project
* Highlight new features added

Important Constraints:

* No authentication implementation required
* Do NOT remove existing functionality
* Do NOT redesign backend architecture completely
* Focus on enhancement, not replacement
